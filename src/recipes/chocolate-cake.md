Pre-heat the oven to 325 F degrees. 

Line an 9-inch spring form pan with parchment paper and grease it generously with coconut oil. Set aside.

To make the batter Mix together the almond flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. In a separate mixing bowl, beat the eggs. Add in the maple syrup and vanilla extract and whisk until fully combined.

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until thoroughly combined.

Pour the batter into the greased pan. Bake for 23 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.

Let it cool on the kitchen counter for 10 minutes. Gently run a knife over the edges and transfer the cake onto a cake plate. Let it cool to room temperature.

When ready to serve, spread the maple whipped cream over the top and decorate it with fruit and mint. Slice and serve.
