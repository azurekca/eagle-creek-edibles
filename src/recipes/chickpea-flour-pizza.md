Combine all ingredients, stir with a fork and let sit for at least 1 hour

Turn oven to broil and place an 8" cast iron pan inside to pre-heat

After 5 min, remove pan, add half the fat, once melted pour half of the mixture into the pan and place under broiler. 

Cook one side for about 8-12 min. Depending on how that went, either flip and cook the other side for about 2 minutes, or place directly onto wire rack, less cooked side down.

Repeat for a second pizza crust, or do it all at once if you have multiple cast iron pans.

Add pizza toppings and place under broiler for another 3-5 min to heat through and melt the cheese.

Enjoy! Makes 2 pizzas.
