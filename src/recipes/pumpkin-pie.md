Make the [Almond flour pie crust](https://eagle-creek-edibles.netlify.app/recipes/slow-carb-pie-and-tart-crust/). Keep the oven at 350F. Let pie crust cool for at least 10 min. before filling.

Mix all ingredients together till combined. For pumpkin pie spice I use 3 cinnamon:1 ginger:1/2 clove: 1/2 nutmeg.

Pour into prepared crust. Cover the exposed crust with a pie shield or a ring of foil.

Bake for 40-50 min. The pie is ready when it has set and is still a little jiggly in the centre.

Cool on the counter, then refrigerate for at least an hour.

Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.
