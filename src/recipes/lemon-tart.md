In a saucepan, add eggs, honey, lemon juice, salt, ghee or butter and zest or extract.

Heat on low until ghee or butter melts, whisking constantly.

Turn heat up a smidgen and continue whisking furiously until it thickens. This will take anywhere from 1 min to 5 min depending on how aggressive you are with the heat. The higher the heat and the more lax you are with the whisking and you will risk scrambling the eggs.

Once thickened, take off heat and continue whisking for another couple of minutes to avoid the aforesaid scrambling.

While the mixture is cooling, sprinkle gelatin over water in a small bowl and let bloom for 5 minutes.

Once the gelatin and water look like a translucent blob, add it to the lemon curd and whisk in.

When the curd has cooled to room temperature, pour into cooled tart shell. If you have some scramble in your custard, strain the curd through a sieve when pouring.

Refrigerate for 2 hours or if you're in a hurry, you can put it in the freezer for about 30-45 min. Enjoy!!
