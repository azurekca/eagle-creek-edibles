Preheat oven to 350 F

Measure out flours and salt into a bowl or food processor.

If adding spices, like cinnamon, add now.

Cut in butter with pastry cutter or pulse in food processor till butter is incorporated. The goal is to get it to a small pea-sized consistency.

If adding extract or maple syrup, add now.

Add enough cold water to help dough stick together.

Press into pie pan or tart shell and prick with fork.

Bake for 20 - 25. Till crust turns golden.

If attempting to make a double crust, good luck! This stuff is hard to roll and move without disintegrating.
