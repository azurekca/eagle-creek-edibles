Make the [Almond flour crust](https://eagle-creek-edibles.netlify.app/recipes/slow-carb-pie-and-tart-crust/) and let cool.

Preheat oven to 375F.

In one bowl, whisk eggs, cream, almond extract, and maple syrup.

In another bowl, whisk flours and salt, then whisk into egg mixture.

Arrange fruit in crust in a single layer, then gently pour the batter around it.

Bake until golden and just set. About 35 - 40 minutes. If your oven heats unevenly, you may want to rotate the tart halfway through.
